    <h1>Potomac Computer Systems (1991–1992)</h1>
    <h3>
      Potomac Computer Systems was founded by Tim Sweeney in 1991.[7] At the
      time, Sweeney was studying mechanical engineering and living in a dorm at
      the University of Maryland. He frequently visited his parents, who lived
      in nearby Potomac, Maryland, where his personal computer, used for both
      work and leisure, was situated.[7] Out of this location, Sweeney started
      Potomac Computer Systems as a computer consulting business, but later
      figured that it would be too much work he would have to put into keeping
      the business stable, and scrapped the idea.[7] After finishing his game
      ZZT, Sweeney opted to re-use the Potomac Computer Systems name to release
      the game to the public in January 1991.[7][8] It was only with the
      unexpected success of ZZT, caused in most part by the easy modifiability
      of the game using Sweeney's custom ZZT-oop programming language,[9] that
      made Sweeney consider turning Potomac Computer Systems into a video game
      company.[7] ZZT was sold through bulletin board systems, while all orders
      were fulfilled by Sweeney's father, Paul Sweeney.[10] The game sold
      several thousand copies as of May 2009, and Paul Sweeney still lived at
      the former Potomac Computer Systems address at the time, fulfilling all
      orders that eventually came by mail.[7][10] The final copy of ZZT was
      shipped by Paul Sweeney in November 2013.[10]

    <h1>Epic MegaGames (1992–1999)</h1>
    <h3>
      In early 1992, Sweeney found himself and his new-found video game company
      in a business where larger studios, such as Apogee Software and id
      Software, were dominant, and he had to find a more serious name for
      his.[7] As such, Sweeney came up with "Epic MegaGames", a name which
      incorporated "Epic" and "Mega" to make it sound like it represented a
      fairly large company (such as Apogee Software), although he was its only
      employee.[7] Sweeney soon underwent searching for a business partner, and
      eventually caught up with Mark Rein, who previously quit his job at id
      Software and moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][7] Rein worked remotely from
      Toronto, and primarily handled sales, marketing and publishing deals;
      business development that Sweeney found to have significantly contributed
      to the company's growth.[7] Some time this season, the company soon had 20
      employees consisting of programmers, artists, designers and composers.[11]
      Among them was the 17-year old Cliff Bleszinski, who joined the company
      after submitting his game Dare to Dream to Sweeney.[12] The following
      year, they had over 30 employees.[13] In 1996, Epic MegaGames produced a
      shareware isometric shooter called Fire Fight, developed by Polish studio
      Chaos Works. It was published by Electronic Arts.[14] By 1997, Epic
      MegaGames had 50 people working for them worldwide.[15] In 1998, Epic
      MegaGames released Unreal, a 3D first-person shooter co-developed with
      Digital Extremes, which expanded into a series of Unreal games. The
      company also began to license the core technology, the Unreal Engine, to
      other game developers.

    <h3>
      In February 1999, Epic MegaGames announced that they had moved their
      headquarters to a new location in Cary, North Carolina, and would
      henceforth be known as simply Epic Games.[16] Rein explained that "Unreal
      was first created by developers who were scattered across the world,
      eventually, the team came together to finish the game and that's when the
      real magic started. The move to North Carolina centralizes Epic, bringing
      all of the company's talented developers under one roof."[16] Furthermore,
      Sweeney stated that the "Mega" part of the name was dropped because they
      no longer wanted to pretend to be a big company, as was the original
      intention of the name when it was a one-man team.[7] The follow-up game,
      Unreal Tournament, shipped to critical acclaim the same year,[17] at which
      point the studio had 13 employees.[18] The company launched the Make
      Something Unreal competition in 2004, aiming to reward video game
      developers who create mods using the Unreal game engine. Tripwire
      Interactive won US$80,000 in cash and computer hardware prizes over the
      course of the contest in the first contest in 2004.[19][20]
