    <h1>Acquisitions</h1>
    <h3>
      In 2008, Epic acquired Utah based Chair Entertainment, developer of
      Undertow.[96][97] Summer 2009 saw the launch of Chair's Shadow Complex, an
      adventure game inspired by the Metroid series.[98] Epic announced in
      October 2018 that it had acquired $1.25 billion in investment from seven
      firms: KKR, ICONIQ Capital, Smash Ventures, aXiomatic, Vulcan Capital,
      Kleiner Perkins, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.
      <br />
      The firms join Tencent, Disney, and Endeavor as minority shareholders in
      Epic.[99][100] With the investment, Epic Games was estimated to have a
      nearly $15 billion valuation in October 2018.[101] Besides expanding
      support for Fortnite and the Epic Games Store, these investments allowed
      Epic to acquire additional firms. In January 2018, it was announced that
      Epic had acquired Cloudgine, a developer of cloud-based gaming
      software.[102] The company also announced the acquisition of Kamu, a firm
      that offered anti-cheat software called Easy Anti-Cheat, in October
      2018.[103][104] A year later, in January 2019, Epic acquired 3Lateral and
      Agog Labs. 3Lateral is known for its "digital human" creations, using a
      combination of digital technology, motion capture, and other tools to
      create photo-realistic human subjects in real time.
      <br />
      Epic plans to add some of 3Lateral's features to the Unreal Engine.[105]
      Agog had developed SkookumScript, a platform for scripting events in video
      games; on announcement of this acquisition, Agog stated they will stop
      development of SkookumScript to work more on Unreal Engine scripting
      support.[106] Epic acquired Psyonix, the developer of Rocket League, in
      May 2019. Epic and Psyonix have had a past history, as Psyonix was
      originally founded a few miles from Epic's headquarters and had
      contributed to Epic's Unreal Tournament.[107][108] Epic acquired the
      Twinmotion visualization tool used in architectural design in May 2019
      from Abvent, and which they plan to expand and incorporate into their
      Unreal Engine offerings.[109] Epic acquired Life on Air, the developers
      behind Houseparty, a social networking service, in June 2019. The monetary
      terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.[110] Epic later shuttered
      Houseparty's app in October 2021, though the team behind it was continuing
      to develop social apps for Epic's platforms.[111] In November 2019, Epic
      acquired Quixel, the world's largest photogrammetry asset library which
      makes 3D models of objects based on real-world high-definition
      photography.
      <br />
      Epic plans to open Quixel's existing library of models to users of Unreal
      Engine, while the Quixel staff will continue to build out its assets
      within Epic.[112][113] The company acquired Cubic Motion, a studio that
      provides highly detailed digital facial animations for both films and
      video games, in March 2020.[114] Epic acquired SuperAwesome, a firm that
      has developed services to support children-safe games and services around
      games, in September 2020, as to incorporate these elements more into
      Epic's portfolio and to offer to other developers, particularly for games
      built around Epic's vision of metaverse games.[115][116] Epic acquired the
      digital facial animation firm Hyprsense in November 2020.[117] In January
      2021, Epic acquired RAD Game Tools, a company that makes a variety of
      middleware solutions for video game development which Epic plans to
      incorporate into the Unreal Engine. RAD's tools will still remain
      available outside of Unreal as well.
      <br />
      [118] In March 2021, Epic announced it was acquiring the Tonic Games
      Group, which includes developers Mediatonic and Fortitude Games.
      Mediatonic's Fall Guys, a major success during 2020, would remain
      available on Steam while Epic would help to bring it to additional
      platforms.[119] Epic buying Tonic Games Group falls under the companyâ€™s
      broader plans of creating its own metaverse.[120] Additionally in March,
      Epic acquired Capturing Reality, the developers of RealityCapture, a
      photogrammetry suite that can create 3D models from numerous photographs.
      Epic plans to integrate RealityCapture into the Unreal Engine.[121] Epic
      Games acquired ArtStation, a professional artists' marketplace, in April
      2021.
      <br />
      As part of the acquisition, ArtStation members would gain access to Epic's
      tools and support such as the Unreal Engine, while the ArtStation
      marketplace will reduce its take on purchases from 30% to 12%.[122] In
      July 2021, Epic acquired Sketchfab, a marketplace for 3D models. As with
      ArtStation, the acquisition allowed Sketchfab to reduce their pricing
      structure, lowering their revenue cut on purchases to 12% and making their
      Sketchfab Plus level of membership free.[123] In November 2021, Epic Games
      acquired Harmonix, a music game developer, for undisclosed terms.[124]
      Harmonix will continue to support their existing games including Rock Band
      4 and Fuser and will help Epic with expanding musical experiences and
      gameplay within Fortnite and Epic's larger metaverse plans.[125] Epic
      acquired the indie music platform Bandcamp in March 2022. Bandcamp is
      expected to remain independently operated under Epic but will gain
      benefits of Epic's backend services.[126][127]
